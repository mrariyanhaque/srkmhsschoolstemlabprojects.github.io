                <h2>What is voltage?</h2>
                <p>Voltage (also known as electric potential difference) is the measure of the electric potential energy per unit charge between two points in a circuit. It represents the driving force that pushes electric charges through a conductor. Voltage is measured in volts (V).
                    
To understand voltage, consider it as the "pressure" that pushes electric charges through a circuit. Higher voltage means more potential energy available to drive the current through the circuit. For example, a 12-volt battery provides a higher potential difference than a 1.5-volt battery.

In summary, voltage is crucial for determining how much current flows in a circuit, according to Ohm's Law, which states that Voltage (V) = Current (I) Ã— Resistance (R).</p>

                <h2>What is Ampere?</h2>
                <p>The ampere (often shortened to **amp**) is the SI unit of electric current. It measures the flow of electric charge through a conductor. Specifically, one ampere is defined as the flow of one coulomb of charge per second. 

In practical terms, it quantifies the rate at which electrical energy is transferred through a circuit. For example, if a circuit carries a current of 2 amps, it means 2 coulombs of charge are passing through any point in the circuit every second. 

The ampere is a fundamental unit in electrical engineering and is crucial for understanding and designing electrical systems.</p>
